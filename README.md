# INST314_Data_Collection

### Project 4 & 5: Data Collection and Sharing (statistics in psychology)
CSV file containing data collected on depression and modern society

### Project 6: Data Collection and Sharing (statistics in sociology)
CSV file containing data collected on 3 types of feminism: Difference-denying (any biological difference between men and women is denied, and is said to be purely due to cultural impositions), Difference-removing (There are biological difference between men and women, but these differences are burdens to women and women must rely on technology to completely remove any biological difference between men and women to be "liberated"), and Difference-honoring (there exist differences that are purely culturally-imposed and not "essential", but holds that in addition to those, there exist genuine essential differences, and denying or removing them harms women). The first three columns give 1-10 agreement rating for each of these concepts in order (1 = strongly disagree and 10 = strongly agree). The fourth column is which of these three concepts the respondent believes has impacted society the most in past few decades. The rest include personal information for the respondent, such as age, gender, occupation, and whether they have been a mother.
